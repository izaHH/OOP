# Project Aim and System Flow

  Taxi or e-hailing service has been commonly used in our community’s daily life. Taxi 
services is the easiest ride sharing management that involves sharing rides in a private or 
company vehicle among one or more fellow passengers. With that in mind, our team will 
develop a taxi reservation system which is a Windows based offline application. This system 
will help both customers and admin in certain ways. The customer will be able to book their 
taxi ahead of time. While the admin will have access to manage employees, customers and 
its services. The system can only be accessed by admin or staff. The staff will help the 
customer to book their ride in order to minimise cancel booking or scam online. This system 
will not only benefit the admin but also the customer as it is more secure for them. This will 
increase human efforts and customer satisfaction.

  To complete the taxi reservation system, it is form of super user, admin. The admin 
can view, update and manage all data information in the system anytime. First of all, they need 
to pass the authentication process which is to sign in or sign up onto the system. Only valid 
users with registered username and password will get to go into the system. Admin will verify 
the customer’s identity by filling in the details in the system. They will then help the customer 
to check the taxi’s availability and schedules to confirm booking.

  To conclude, our taxi reservation system is secure and user friendly as it will 
convenient the user. The customers will be able to reserve their taxi ride by visiting the nearest 
taxi booking booth
